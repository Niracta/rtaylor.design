#### About Me

I chose my path in design because my parents convinced me that my ardent desire to forge swords and rebuild historical costumes wouldn’t ever be profitable (imagine my surprise when Etsy & Cosplay took off!) It took me several years to find what it was I loved about design work, but there's so much. I started in pre-press, understanding the intricacies of offset printing and the magic of ink. I worked in package design and had the good fortune to ignite a spark of interest as I built brand guidelines. But the opportunity was limited, so I switched to medical marketing — helping build creative campaigns and marketing solutions for independent audiology clinics. Along the way I learned what fueled me as an artist, and pursued my own skills in DSLR photography, video editing, some 3D printing, and UX/UI.

In my spare time, I’m often founds in online communities to offer advice and lend support on fostering healthy relationships and navigating complex emotions. When I work with my hands, I enjoy bookbinding, building miniature models, and organizing cluttered spaces. All other hours I might be found excitedly pointing out mushrooms, suppressing my excitement to quietly point out birds, or otherwise meandering through the amazing PNW with my loved ones.

I hold a B.F.A. in Communication Design, and am open to new opportunities. Reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rtaylordesign/) to connect with me, or see what my coworkers have had to say.
