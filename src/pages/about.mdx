#### About Me

I’m Rachel - a graphic designer with over five years of corporate experience building and implementing design systems. My credo is that communication is the key to success in any workplace, and in life.

</Split>

Graphic design is, when you break it down, simply a form of communication. Much like any language uses rules to order its elements so that they reliably convey meaning, so too does graphic design. As a designer, I believe that it is vitally important to understand and manage how rules are used to more effectively build and elevate a work.

My focus on rule-oriented systems and limitations stems from my experience working in screenprinting and prepress for process printing, both of which have strict processes. This interest grew as I moved into packaging design where I used and learned from pre-established systems for brands like GE and Disney to construct new artworks. It wasn’t long before I was at work developing new constraint systems to define the work my team was building, and reflecting on my own processes.

I eagerly pursue detail-oriented work, and love working with a team that values thoughtful, intentional design. I’m currently working as a graphic designer and am always interested in exploring new systems and challenges.
