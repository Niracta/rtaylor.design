Hi, I’m Rachel. I am a visual designer specializing in process refinement, systems thinking, accessible design, and identity.

I have a background in process printing and package design working with brands such as GE and Honeywell, and nearly a decade of expertise helping teams work more cohesively and efficiently at scale. After a brief foray into technical writing, I am currently focused on moving back into design systems and digital work.

I am currently available for projects large and small, contract roles and full-time opportunities.
